---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset

Housing Price Prediction Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features related to houses such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and other amenities used to predict house prices.

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Imported and explored the dataset
2. Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a **Linear Regression model**
5. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score
6. Plotted actual vs predicted prices
7. Interpreted model coefficients

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Results

* **MAE:** 970,043
* **MSE:** 1.75 × 10¹²
* **RMSE:** 1,324,506
* **R² Score:** 0.65

### 📈 Interpretation

* The model explains **65% of the variance** in house prices.
* The average prediction error is approximately **₹9.7 lakhs**.
* The model demonstrates moderate performance and captures significant price patterns.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Understanding assumptions of Linear Regression
* Difference between simple and multiple regression
* Importance of evaluation metrics
* Interpretation of regression coefficients
* Impact of features on house prices

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

The Linear Regression model was successfully implemented and evaluated.
The model achieved a moderate R² score and provides reasonably accurate predictions.
Further improvements can be made using advanced regression techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
